# Export Material Component Keys (Dev Tool)

1. Duplicate the Material 3 library file into your Figma team and publish it.
2. Open the library file, run this dev plugin, and the JSON catalog will be copied to your clipboard.
3. Paste the JSON into `catalog/component-catalog.json` within this repo.
4. Rebuild the main plugin so it can reference the updated component keys.
